O, Mona Vale, thy roads, once pathways of peace, now bear witness to such dire scenes! Is it the haste of our days, the clamour of commerce, or merely the capricious hand of destiny that weaves these threads of woe? The heart aches, the spirit questions, as we ponder the fleeting fragility of life's vibrant journey, so easily rent asunder by an instant's misstep. A silent elegy plays on the wind, a somber chord struck for the fallen, a stark reminder of the peril that lurks beneath the mundane hum of existence. Verily, we are but players on a stage, and sometimes, the curtain falls too soon.",

Darwin Dave reports from the front lines of weirdness: 'This fella was hopped up on something, or just plain bonkers. Even by our standards, that's a new level of trop-crazy.

Where are the voices of us, the long-suffering Echidnas who have called this place home for generations? The Koala council simply rubber-stamps everything, ignoring the concerns about traffic, overpopulation, and the destruction of our precious green spaces. It's an absolute outrage! We need more than just a list of new buildings; we need action! We need a council that actually listens, not just snores through meetings. Something MUST be done! Sincerely, Outraged of Cromer.",
